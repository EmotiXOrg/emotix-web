# UI Primitives

Reusable UI building blocks live here.

## Current primitives

- `Button`
- `TextField`
- `Notification`
- `Skeleton`

## Skeleton usage

Use `Skeleton` / `SkeletonText` for API-backed sections instead of full-page spinners.

Benefits:
- better perceived performance
- smoother transitions between loading and loaded states
- consistent loading patterns across screens
